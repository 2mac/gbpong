Pong on the Game Boy!

This small game is designed as a demonstration for Delwink's libstdgb library
for developing for the Game Boy. Since Pong is the "hello world" of game
development, I thought it would be well-suited as a test of the library's
capabilities and the readability of its API.

Build Instructions
------------------

You'll need the GNU Make, Small Device C Compiler (SDCC) and Wand for
Python 3. On Debian-based systems, you can install as follows:

    # apt-get install make sdcc python3-wand

After that, just run

    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update
    $ make

Finally, you'll have `pong.gb` which can be run on an emulator or flashed to
your programmable cartridge.

Hacking
-------

gbpong uses the GNU coding style for C with a strict 79-column limit in its
source code. Tabs may be used in place of 8 spaces when indenting.

Since the Game Boy is a very limited platform, code is expected to be written
for binary efficiency. If you're just getting into Game Boy development, try
mixing around nested `if` checks, and evaluate when pointers can efficiently be
used, and check the output of `gbromgen` to see how your code affects the
binary size.
