Pong on the Game Boy!

This small game is designed as a demonstration for Delwink's libstdgb library
for developing for the Game Boy. Since Pong is the "hello world" of game
development, I thought it would be well-suited as a test of the library's
capabilities and the readability of its API.

Build Instructions
------------------

You'll need the GNU Make, Small Device C Compiler (SDCC) and Wand for
Python 3. On Debian-based systems, you can install as follows:

    # apt-get install make sdcc python3-wand

After that, just run

    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update
    $ make

Finally, you'll have `pong.gb` which can be run on an emulator or flashed to
your programmable cartridge.

If you get a syntax error while compiling, try

    $ make CFLAGS=-DINT_BOOLS

On older versions of SDCC, the `bool` type doesn't work properly, so I added a
way to use integers as boolean types. It makes the binary a bit larger and the
computation slower, but it should still work.

Hacking
-------

Match the style you see in the code. Do not use spaces for indentation.

Since the Game Boy is a very limited platform, code is expected to be written
for binary efficiency. If you're just getting into Game Boy development, try
mixing around nested `if` checks, and evaluate when pointers can efficiently be
used, and check the output of `gbromgen` to see how your code affects the
binary size.
