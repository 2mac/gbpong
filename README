Pong on the Game Boy!

Build Instructions
------------------

You'll need the GNU Make, Small Device C Compiler (SDCC) and Wand for
Python 3. On Debian-based systems, you can install as follows:

    # apt-get install make sdcc python3-wand

After that, just run

    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update
    $ make

Finally, you'll have `pong.gb` which can be run on an emulator or flashed to
your programmable cartridge.

Hacking
-------

gbpong uses the GNU coding style for C with a strict 79-column limit in its
